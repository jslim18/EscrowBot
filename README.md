    'Enable' - your bot will only receive messages that either start with the '/' symbol or mention the bot by username.

26. Wait until you see a long text with `"ok": true` and your bot's name. This could take a minute or so, please reload if it does not succeed.

27. Now, go to https://`project-id`.appspot.com/set_webhook?url=https://`project-id`.appspot.com/webhook (replace both `project-id`s with the Project ID you set on step 16).

28. You should see `Webhook was set`.

29. Open your Telegram client and send the message `/start` to your bot. (type @`your-bot-username` at the search field to initiate the conversation)

30. You can, for example, send `what time` to the bot and the bot will reply you. Try sending `/image` as well. Mission completed!

To customize the bot, edit the `main.py` starting from the `CUSTOMIZE FROM HERE` line. They are simple if-else statements.
